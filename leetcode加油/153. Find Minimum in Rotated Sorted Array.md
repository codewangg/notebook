# <span style='color:#99cc66;background:背景颜色;font-size:文字大小;'>153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array</span>

Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:

- `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.
- `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums`, return *the minimum element of this array*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
Output: 11
Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times. 
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == nums.length`

- `1 <= n <= 5000`

- `-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000`

- #### <span style='color:red;background:背景颜色;font-size:文字大小;'>All the integers of `nums` are **unique**.</span>

- `nums` is sorted and rotated between `1` and `n` times.

    

```python
class Solution(object):
    def findMin(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        l,r = 0,len(nums)-1
        while l <= r:
            mid = (l+r)//2
            if nums[l] < nums[r]: ##说明当前子array是sorted，直接返回最左端
                return nums[l]
            else:
                if nums[mid] >= nums[l]:##以断层为中届，mid在左边，断层右边的值都比left最小的值还小
                    l = mid + 1 #在左边，而且mid肯定不是最小值所在index，所以=mid+1
                else:
                    r = mid #####<<<<<<<<<<注意这里！！！！在断层右边，有可能mid指向最小元素，所以不能丢掉mid
        if l >= len(nums):
            return nums[r]
        if r < 0:
            return nums[l]
        return min(nums[l],nums[r])
```

line16 如果像平时一样写成 r = mid -1, 当mid指向最小元素时这个元素会被跳过

## 还有一种直接判断mid是不是inflection point转折点的方法
